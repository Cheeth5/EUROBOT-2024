for the main robot we used 2 systems :

1- the first one catch all the plants and lift them so they can be puted inside the planters 

2- for the second system we used a double lift systems that lift at first time the plants turn them by 90° and at a second time
it lift the pots then it turns the plants lifted by -90° so they can be puted in the pots
